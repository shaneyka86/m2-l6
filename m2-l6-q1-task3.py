# Task 3: Review Summary
#Implement a script that takes the first 30 characters of a review and appends "â€¦" 
# to create a summary. Ensure that the summary does not cut off in the middle of a word.
#Example: "This product is really good. I'm...",

        "Poor quality product. Wouldn't recommend it to anyone.",
